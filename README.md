# My Frontend Portfolio

Displaying various projects built in React, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, you can find some more information on who I am and a few articles I've written based on my thought on code, especially code and animation together. 

The portfolio site itself is built in HTML and CSS following visual guidelines by Technigo.

A constant work in progress, continuously updating with new projects and information.
